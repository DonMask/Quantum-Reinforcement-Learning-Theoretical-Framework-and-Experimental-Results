# Quantum-Reinforcement-Learning-Theoretical-Framework-and-Experimental-Results v1.0

Welcome to the repository for the **Quantum RL Framework v1.0**, a sophisticated quantum decision-making system that integrates quantum circuits with reinforcement learning (Q-learning) for adaptive biofeedback optimization. Released on May 11, 2025, this work demonstrates applications in stress management, personalized healthcare, and financial portfolio optimization, achieving a performance rate of 0.74â€“0.91 and outperforming classical methods by 4-6% in suboptimal decisions.

This project leverages IBM Quantum hardware and Qiskit simulations, with a peak performance of 0.910 under low noise conditions (p=0.01).

## Overview
This repository hosts the LaTeX source files and compiled PDF for the paper *"Quantum-Reinforcement-Learning-Theoretical-Framework-and-Experimental-Results"*. The study validates a hybrid quantum-RL system, highlighting its advantages over classical reinforcement learning across 200 simulation cycles with noise levels ranging from p=0.01 to p=0.5.

- **Key Results**: Converges to 0.85 after 25 cycles, with phase-flip noise mitigation achieving 0% suboptimal decisions at p=0.01.
- **Applications**: Stress management, healthcare, and finance (5% higher Sharpe ratio than Markowitz).
- **Future Directions**: Focus on multi-qubit scaling, real-time integration, and long-term cost reduction.
