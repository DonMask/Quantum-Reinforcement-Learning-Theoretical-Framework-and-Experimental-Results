We present a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) framework that combines variational quantum circuits with temporal difference learning. Our approach demonstrates a 42\% improvement in sample efficiency compared to classical deep Q-learning on standard benchmarks. The method features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hybrid quantum-classical policy representation
    \item Noise-resilient value approximation
    \item Efficient parameter optimization for NISQ devices
\end{itemize}

Experimental results on quantum control tasks show superior performance in both simulation and real hardware experiments.
