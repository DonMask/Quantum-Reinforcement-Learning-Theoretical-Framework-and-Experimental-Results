Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving sequential decision problems on quantum computers \cite{dong2022quantum}. While existing approaches have shown potential, they face three key challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Policy representation on limited-qubit systems
    \item Credit assignment in noisy environments
    \item Sample-efficient training protocols
\end{enumerate}

Our work addresses these challenges through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A compact quantum policy encoding
    \item Temporal difference error mitigation
    \item Hybrid quantum-classical optimization
\end{itemize}

The complete methodology is presented in Section \ref{sec:method}.
